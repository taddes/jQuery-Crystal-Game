# jQuery Crystal Game

jQuery and JavaScript guessing game.
<hr>
**Instructions:**

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

The number value of each crystal is hidden until the player clicks a crystal.
When the player does click one, the score counter is updated.
The goal is to find the values of the crystals and add them up to the random number without going past it.
The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. Wins and losses are tracked in a counter.

Every time the game starts over, the crystal values and random number change.
